1. Download all the files.
2. Unzip data.rar to the "data" folder.
3. Tune the hyper-parameters following the instruction in run_model_evaluation.py.
4. Run run_model_evaluation.py to get evaluation results.

Instead of the framework name in the manuscript (i.e., Muthene), we use HNEMA (Heterogeneous Network Embedding with Meta-path Aggregation) here to define the function.
